# GiftGift
GiftGift is a simple "gift draw" web application, just in time for the holidays. It allows you to build a list of "givers", enter any exclusions (for example, Eddie may not want to buy for Patch), and then do a random draw. This is a KnockoutJS sample project. (It's been great to work with so far!)
